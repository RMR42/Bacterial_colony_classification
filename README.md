# Bacterial_colony_classification

###
Development of a useful model in the field of microbiology which is diagnostically useful to recognize various genera and species of bacteria. Achieved using computer-aided methods, which make bacterial recognition processes more automatic and thus significantly reduce the time necessary for the classification in health and research fields.
